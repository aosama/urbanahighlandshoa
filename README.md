# Urbana Highlands Home Owners Association

This repository tracks the work to modernize the Urbana Highlands HOA website.

## Job scope (facelift)

The current expectation is a **facelift of the existing site**, keeping it hosted and managed in **WordPress**.

In other words: update the design, layout, and content presentation while preserving the site’s current purpose as a resident hub (links out to the resident portal, pool pass system, events, and announcements).

## Hosting / platform

- Current hosting/platform: **WordPress** (legacy site)

## Legacy website

- The legacy web site can be found at [https://www.urbanahighlandshoa.com/](https://www.urbanahighlandshoa.com/)

## Documentation
